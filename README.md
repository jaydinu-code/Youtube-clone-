# YouTube Clone ðŸŽ¥  

This is a practice project built while learning **HTML** and **CSS**.  
The goal was to recreate the layout of YouTubeâ€™s homepage to get hands-on experience with:  

- HTML structure and semantic elements  
- CSS styling (flexbox, grid, positioning)  
- Responsive layouts  
- Reusable components (header, sidebar, video grid, etc.)  

## ðŸš€ Features
- Header with search bar, icons, and profile picture  
- Sidebar navigation  
- Video grid layout with thumbnails, channel pictures, and video info
